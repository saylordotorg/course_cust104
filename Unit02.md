**Unit 2: Knowing Your Customers** <span id="2"></span> 
*Comparing the job of a customer service representative with an actor on
a stage is not a perfect analogy. For example, although actors do
interact with their audience in a collective sense, it is usually not
reasonable, or even possible, for an actor to isolate one audience
member and respond only to that person. And yet, that is exactly what
you must do most of the time when you are dealing with customers. On the
other hand, like the actor, as a customer service expert you must
respect and react to the characteristics of your audience, making note
of their general demeanor and remaining ever vigilant for the feedback
they provide that will guide your own actions.*  
    
 *John Russell, President of Harley Davidson, said: “The more you engage
with customers, the clearer things become and the easier it is to
determine what you should be doing.”[[1]](#_ftn1)*

     Instructions: On the homepage, click on the blue-colored phrases
    *Project Implicit* or *click here*, which are located in the first
    two paragraphs, to enter the testing area. This page will allow you
    to register for the test, but registration is not necessary. If you
    choose not to register, choose your country of origin in the
    drop-down menu and click Go. Read through the Preliminary
    Information to understand how your responses will be handled and
    then click on *I wish to proceed*.  
        
     The next webpage presents a list of tests you can take based on
    specific cultural characteristics. Read through the brief
    descriptions of each test, decide which test(s) you want to take,
    and click on the blue box to begin. Return to the main screen with
    the list of tests if/when you are ready to take another test.  
        
     *Why take these tests? *This activity is designed to heighten your
    awareness of cultural bias, which can influence your perceptions and
    communication in culturally diverse settings. Becoming more aware of
    your biases can help you avoid communication mistakes that can
    negatively impact how you interact with customers from other
    cultures.  
        
     Many of these tests are interactive, and you may find some of them
    fun. However, some may reveal traits you disagree with. Make sure
    you take the time to click through and read the information
    following each test to understand what your results mean and how
    they compare to those of other people.  
        
     Although these tests are designed primarily for Americans, they are
    still valuable for understanding cultural bias even if you are not
    American.  
        
     Completing each test and reading the explanations of your results
    should take at least 1 hour, depending on the number of tests you
    choose to take.
