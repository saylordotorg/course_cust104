**Unit 6: Creating a Visual Impression** <span id="6"></span> 
*Award-winning costume designer Judith Bowden has explained that an
actor’s costume “must provide strong visual support for the story,
concept, and context of the play as a whole.”[[1]](#_ftn1) Like an
actor, you too must provide visible support for your role in customer
service. From the clothes and accessories you wear to the way you
display products or demonstrate services, you use visual communication
whenever you interact with customers. Visual communication is influenced
the most by what customers see, not by what they hear or read, and can
be used to attract customers’ attention, help them understand how
products function, direct them to locations, emphasize what is
important, and make their experience with you and your business more
pleasurable and more memorable. This course concludes with the topic of
visual communication because it is often what produces customers’ first
and last impressions – impressions of you, of what you offer them, and
of everything they saw with regard to your business.*  
    
 *Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon.com, said: “We see our customers as invited
guests to a party, and we are the hosts. It’s our job every day to make
every important aspect of the customer experience a little bit
better.”[[2]](#_ftn2)*

     Instructions: Listen to this podcast, which focuses on connecting
    business success with visual communication. You will find that the
    guest interviewed in this podcast focuses on the level of business
    management rather than customer service. However, you need to
    realize that many management decisions impact your role as a
    customer service agent, too. As a result, understanding why those
    decisions are made should also be important to you. Pay particular
    attention to the rationale for visual communication in business
    settings, which the guest provides at the 6:55-minute mark.  
        
     Listening to this podcast and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: Read this brief article, which emphasizes the roles
    that visual communication elements can play in retail and other
    public settings.  
        
     Reading this article and taking notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.

**6.2 Understanding Retail Design and Merchandising** <span
id="6.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: Wikipedia.org’s “Retail Design”**
    Link: Wikipedia.org’s [“Retail
    Design”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail_design) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this article, but focus primarily on the
    discussion of elements that contribute to customers’ impressions and
    understanding of the products or services offered. Since this is a
    highly specialized area of retail business support, it is unlikely
    that you will have a direct impact on how your customer service
    environment is controlled by retail design. Nevertheless,
    understanding how the layout of where you work affects, for example,
    the flow of customers from one area to another, why and where
    products are positioned, or how lighting or stand-alone displays can
    influence how customers see or handle products enables you to
    anticipate your customers’ needs, avoid problems, or make
    recommendations to your management.

     Instructions: Watch this video, paying special attention to how the
    host describes the relationships between what a customer sees and
    what a customer thinks about the sales environment he or she has
    entered. Also remember that while you may not be personally
    responsible for visual communication where you work, as a customer
    service representative you may be expected to maintain the displays
    and other visual elements that characterize your work area.  
        
     Remember, too, that your work area is the stage on which you
    perform so you have a vested interest in keeping it as functional
    and aesthetically pleasing as possible. In addition, understanding
    how retail merchandising works to create a customer-friendly space
    will enable you to recognize when repairs, replacements,
    adjustments, restocking, cleaning, or other kinds of assistance may
    be needed.

**6.3 Understanding Yourself as a Visual: Being on Stage** <span
id="6.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: CustomerService.Top16.com’s “All of the World of Business
    Is a Stage”**
    Link: CustomerService.Top16.com’s [“All of the World of Business Is
    a Stage”](http://customerservice.top16.com/52888.php) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this brief article, which reinforces the theme
    that began this course: Working in customer service is similar to
    the work of an actor on a stage.  
        
     In this last subunit, turn your attention to where you fit into the
    customer service environment. This course has covered many aspects
    of that setting, but only you can relate the topics covered to the
    circumstances in which you work, now or in the future. Considering
    yourself as a visual is one straightforward way to make that leap
    from the theoretical to the practical, so as you read through this
    material, think about how it relates to your own working
    conditions.  
        
     Reading this article and taking notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.

**6.3.1 Personal Appearance** <span id="6.3.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: SkillsYouNeed.com’s “Personal Appearance”**
    Link: SkillsYouNeed.com’s [“Personal
    Appearance”](http://www.skillsyouneed.com/ps/personal-appearance.html) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this article, including the section on “Body
    Language.” Pay particular attention to how the contents relate to
    your own circumstances. For example, are you able to follow the
    advice to smile, regardless of how you feel inside? Why or why not?
    Finding a way to generate facial expressions like smiling, even when
    you don’t feel like it, might be the difference between becoming an
    excellent customer service agent and just an average one.  
        
     This reading covers the material you need to know for subunits
    6.3.1.1 through 6.3.1.3.  
        
     Reading this article and taking notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.  
        
     Terms of Use: Please respect the copyright and terms of use
    displayed on the webpage above.

**6.3.1.1 Facial Expressions** <span id="6.3.1.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 6.3.1. The
greatest value you can get from reading about these topics will be
produced if you think about your own traits while you read the material.
For example, the difference between the on-duty you and the off-duty you
is an important one in customer service. Like an actor going on stage,
you must remember to put on your on-duty face when you get to work.*

**6.3.1.2 Clothes and Grooming** <span id="6.3.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 6.3.1. Remember
to think about your own traits while you read the material. In the case
of clothing and grooming, both your own traits and those of your
employer are important. This reading emphasizes how the way you package
yourself visually should match the way the company you work for presents
itself and its products or services.*

**6.3.1.3 Body Language** <span id="6.3.1.3"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 6.3.1. Pay
special attention to the reading material’s explanation of how body
language is often more influential than the words we speak. If you find
yourself working under pressure, such as during busy holidays or with
difficult customers, controlling your body language so that it
compliments instead of contradicts your verbal language can have a
significant impact on your success.*

**6.3.2 Confidence** <span id="6.3.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: SkillsYouNeed.com’s “Building Confidence”**
    Link: SkillsYouNeed.com’s [“Building
    Confidence”](http://www.skillsyouneed.com/ps/confidence.html) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this brief article, paying particular attention
    to how the contents relate to your own circumstances. For example,
    ask yourself about your own level of confidence. The readings point
    to several reasons why some people lack confidence in themselves. Do
    any of those reasons apply to you? If so, read through the seven
    ways the readings suggest will help you become more confident and
    then consider which ones would suit your particular needs.  
        
     Reading this article and taking notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.

**6.3.3 Empathy** <span id="6.3.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: SkillsYouNeed.com’s “What Is Empathy?”**
    Link: SkillsYouNeed.com’s [“What Is
    Empathy?”](http://www.skillsyouneed.com/ips/empathy.html) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this webpage, paying particular attention to how
    the contents relate to your own circumstances. Make sure you take
    from the reading the connection between being able to “walk a mile
    in another person’s shoes” and understanding customer behavior.
    Realize that this is something you can actually practice simply by
    asking yourself, “Why?” This question is related to the reading’s
    emphasis on using your imagination. When you ask yourself “Why does
    that person act that way?” or “Why does she want that?” or even “Why
    is he so upset?” you begin the process of seeing the world through
    someone else’s eyes.  
        
     Reading this webpage and taking notes should take approximately 15

**6.3.4 Charisma** <span id="6.3.4"></span> 
-   **Reading: SkillsYouNeed.com’s “What Is Charisma? How to Be
    Charismatic”**
    Link: SkillsYouNeed.com’s [“What Is Charisma? How to Be
    Charismatic”](http://www.skillsyouneed.com/ips/charisma.html) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this webpage, focusing on how you can become
    more charismatic, even if charisma is not one of your natural
    traits. You will find several references in the reading material to
    information already presented to you in this unit and throughout the
    course, such as confidence (6.3.2), personal appearance (6.3.1),
    active listening (3.5), and nonverbal communication (1.3.2 and
    3.5.1). Consider reviewing these subunits to connect their concepts
    specifically with charisma.  
        
     For example, there are aspects of nonverbal communication that you
    can consciously adopt to enhance your charismatic qualities. Affect
    displays, regulators, and posture are three in particular that can
    have significant effects on what others perceive as your charisma.
    If you don’t recall what those body language traits refer to, click
    on the “Non-Verbal Communication” link on the webpage above to
    refresh your memory.  
        
     This material also covers the topics you will need to understand in
    subunits 6.3.4.1 and 6.3.4.2.  
        
     Reading this webpage and taking notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.  
        
     Terms of Use: Please respect the copyright and terms of use
    displayed on the webpage above.

**6.3.4.1 Defining Charisma** <span id="6.3.4.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 6.3.4. As the
readings indicate, charisma is often the trait which makes a person
stand out and create a lasting impression. Not everyone is born with it,
but you can work on your charismatic qualities. As a customer service
agent, you can use charismatic traits to generate trust and loyalty with
your customers, results which are sure to make your bosses happy. *

**6.3.4.1.1 Being a Confident Person** <span id="6.3.4.1.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 6.3.4. As with
the personal appearance subunits in 6.3.1, the greatest value you can
get from reading about these topics will be produced if you are thinking
about your own traits while you read the material. In this case, you
should be considering how your level of confidence, especially when you
are working as a customer service agent, impacts your personality,
including how charismatic you are or can become.*

**6.3.4.1.2 Being an Optimist** <span id="6.3.4.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 6.3.4. This
material emphasizes how optimism plays a role in charisma – or at least
how appearing to be optimistic can reinforce charismatic traits.
Optimism is a reflection of your mindset or world view. It is often
referred to in conjunction with positive thinking and, as these readings
point out, it can be contagious, making it an excellent trait to pass
along to your customers.*

**6.3.4.1.3 Being an Emotional Player** <span id="6.3.4.1.3"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 6.3.4. This
material emphasizes what this entire course has pointed out: that
customer service sometimes requires an agent to be an actor, too. An
emotional player, like an actor, is able to turn on and off his or her
emotions as conditions warrant, making this yet another important skill
you may want to develop. *

**6.3.4.1.4 Being Interesting and Interested** <span
id="6.3.4.1.4"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 6.3.4. As you
read this material, focus on the role interest plays in capturing and
convincing an audience. Realize that sometimes you have to generate
interest – in you or in the products or services you represent.
Interest, in turn, can produce many useful emotions and behaviors in
your customers, including enthusiasm, involvement, cooperation, and even
action. *

**6.3.4.2 Understanding Charisma** <span id="6.3.4.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 6.3.4.As you
read through the following descriptions, you may think that you cannot
adopt traits that are not an inherent part of your personal nature.
However, that is incorrect. Remember that the readings emphasize how
“charisma is the result of excellent communication and interpersonal
skills, as such skills can be learned and developed – so developing our
own charisma is possible.”*

**6.3.4.2.1 Intelligence** <span id="6.3.4.2.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 6.3.4. The key
point you need to take away from this part of the reading material is
that most charismatic individuals have significant expertise in some
area, usually the area in which they interact with others. For you, as a
customer service agent, this area should be the business your employer
is in, including the products or services it offers. By knowing your
business well, you will naturally impart many of the characteristics of
a charismatic person, including intelligence.*

**6.3.4.2.2 Assertiveness** <span id="6.3.4.2.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 6.3.4. As you
complete this reading material, realize that being assertive is not the
same as being aggressive. Both are behaviors that can influence others,
but assertiveness is encouraging in subtle ways, while aggressiveness
rarely goes unnoticed, which makes it particularly unsuitable in
customer service where a strong, obvious push – sometimes referred to as
the hard sell – can make customers uncomfortable, resentful, and
resistant.*

**6.3.4.2.3 Attentiveness** <span id="6.3.4.2.3"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 6.3.4. In this
material, attentiveness refers to attention to detail. A charismatic
person is a person who is highly aware of his or her environment and his
or her self. You should take away from this entire section of reading
that what really drives charisma is control and awareness: in other
words, attention to detail at all times.*

**6.3.5 Matching Style with Setting** <span id="6.3.5"></span> 
-   **Reading: SkillsYouNeed.com’s “Personal Presentation”**
    Link: SkillsYouNeed.com’s [“Personal
    Presentation”](http://www.skillsyouneed.com/ps/personal-presentation.html) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this webpage, paying particular attention to how
    the contents relate to your own circumstances. The key idea in this
    material is that, just as the business you work for must be
    concerned about how it appears to the public, so should you.
    Projecting the right image, one that matches your company’s image
    and the products or services it offers, involves more than how you
    dress. It also involves your verbal and nonverbal style: how you
    speak, how you appear, and how you manage your time. These are
    traits you can improve on, especially if you are willing to change,
    and then practice and persevere.  
        
     Reading this webpage and taking notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.  
        
     Terms of Use: Please respect the copyright and terms of use

**6.3.5.1 Effective Speaking** <span id="6.3.5.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 6.3.5 and is
also covered in much greater depth in subunit 5.1. As you read about
this topic, keep in mind that the context for considering it in this
subunit is how it affects your appearance and style. Also remember one
point emphasized in the preceding subunit was how important it is that
your external traits, such as your appearance and style, match that of
the business you represent. As this reading notes, improving your
personal presentation, which includes how you communicate, can have a
direct impact on your success.*

**6.3.5.2 Personal Appearance** <span id="6.3.5.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 6.3.5 and also
in subunit 6.3.1. The material focuses on how self-esteem and confidence
are reflected in your personal appearance. Realize, however, that this
reflection can be both positive and negative. You may think that how you
feel is an internal quality that you can hide, if necessary; however,
that is not always the case, especially if you are unaware of those
feelings.*  
    
 *Low self-esteem is not a personal trait most people are familiar with,
even though we all experience it to one extent or another. This material
emphasizes how important it is to find ways to combat low self-esteem by
increasing your confidence. As your reading suggests, one very effective
way to boost your confidence is to become as knowledgeable as you can
about the products, services, and/or business you represent and how you
can make them attractive to your customers.*

**6.3.5.3 Confidence and Personality** <span id="6.3.5.3"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 6.3.5 as well
as by the reading assignment below.*

-   **Reading: Customer Service Reader: “Customer Service and the
    Pursuit of Happiness”**
    Link: Customer Service Reader: [“Customer Service and the Pursuit of
    Happiness”](http://customerservicereader.typepad.com/customer_service_reader/) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this article, which ends just above the heading
    “Strategic Advantage through Customer Service.” This article makes a
    connection between your outlook and your look.  
        
     When you pursue a career in customer service, it is very important
    that you recognize how what you feel inside can show itself on your
    outside. To succeed, you must discipline yourself, like an actor on
    a stage, to play the role you have chosen.  
        
     Taking this course on customer service is a good way to become more
    familiar with that role, but remaining conscious of the unique
    communication elements you encounter on your own – and using the
    Extended Shannon and Weaver model of communication to recognize what
    those elements are and how you can anticipate or respond to them –
    is another very good step toward becoming a confident, effective,
    and happy customer service representative.  
        
     Reading this article and taking notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.
