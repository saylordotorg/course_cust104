**Unit 1: Understanding Communication** <span id="1"></span> 
*A model is not just a pretty person in a suit or a dress; a model can
also be a representation of something complex that shows you how its
parts successfully function by working together or fail by falling
apart. Fifty years ago, Claude Elwood Shannon and Warren Weaver created
a model of communication that remains one of the most popular
representations of the parts – or* elements – *that good communicators
use to produce effective messages and to respond appropriately to
messages they receive. In this unit, you will examine the elements of
effective communication and then apply Shannon and Weaver’s model – your
blank stage upon which you will eventually perform the role of customer
service expert – to plan and practice the way you interact with your
audience – your customers.*  
    
 *American author and cartoonist James Thurber stated: “Precision of
communication is important, more important than ever in our era of
hair-trigger balances, when a false or misunderstood word may create as
much disaster as a sudden thoughtless act.”[[1]](#_ftn1)*
