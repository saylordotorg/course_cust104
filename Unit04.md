**Unit 4: Providing Information for Customers** <span id="4"></span> 
*The former U.S. Senator and widely respected language scholar S.I.
Hayakawa often argued that you should put your thoughts in writing
because learning to write is learning to think. Unfortunately, customer
service can’t be performed from a script. When you are on stage and
interacting with your customers, the script has to be in your head, not
on paper. However, you still need writing skills. As Hayakawa implies,
writing organizes the messages you want to communicate and enables you
to choose and edit your ideas into their most effective formats. As a
result, while you may not be responsible for a lot of writing in
customer service, you will constantly use the patterns and forms of
communication that writing introduces. Learning those patterns –
referred to as* principles*in the readings for this unit – becoming
comfortable with those formats, and shaping your words for maximum
impact enable customer service experts to communicate with clarity,
efficiency, and impact, whether that is done on paper, face-to-face, or
just in your brain.*  
    
 *Legendary American author Mark Twain said: “The difference between the
right word and the almost right word is the difference between lightning
and the lightning bug.”[[1]](#_ftn1)*

**4.2.1 Colloquial Writing** <span id="4.2.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned in subunit 4.2.
Pay particular attention to how the reading explains when and why this
type of writing is suitable and when and why it is not. Employers and

    [“Chapter 9:
    Introduction”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Business%20Communication%20for%20Success.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: If you have already downloaded *Business
    Communication for Success*, read the introduction to chapter 9 on
    page 324. This reading establishes the justification for anyone
    working for a business to have good writing skills. Be sure to do

    Link: The Saylor Foundation’s [“CUST104 Discussion
    Forum”](http://forums.saylor.org/) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Take a look at *Business Communication for Success*’s
    “Introductory Exercise 1” on page 324 in chapter 9. Post your
    responses to this exercise in the Saylor Discussion Forum for this
    course and see what forms of business writing are described by
    others. Which are the most common? Which are less common?  
        
     As you continue working through this subunit, see if you can
    identify more specific answers to these questions. The process will
    help you anticipate the kind of writing expectations you may
    encounter in a new customer service position.  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 30 minutes.

**4.3.1 Traditional Business Writing** <span id="4.3.1"></span> 
**4.3.1.1 Instant Messaging or Text Messages** <span
id="4.3.1.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: The Saylor Foundation’s *Business Communication for
    Success*: “Chapter 9: Section 9.1”**
    Link: The Saylor Foundation’s *Business Communication for Success*:
    [“Chapter 9: Section
    9.1”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Business%20Communication%20for%20Success.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: If you have already downloaded *Business
    Communication for Success*, read section 9.1: “Text, E-mail, and
    Netiquette” on pages 325–331. As you review this material, recognize
    that instant messaging (IM) and text messages, or texting, are not
    really *traditional* media, but they have been included in this
    subunit because the reading covers them in this order.  
        
     Realize, too, that while some businesses are using broadcast
    texting – a marketing technique that involves sending a large number
    of people the same text message – your role as a customer service
    representative would be to handle individual customers’ responses
    after they receive the broadcast text messages.  
        
     This is why it is important for you to know what broadcast texts
    are – not so that you can originate them, but rather so that you are
    prepared to respond to customers who may inquire about the text’s
    marketing message.  
        
     On the other hand, you yourself may originate instant messages to
    communicate efficiently with coworkers or managers. One way you
    could do this is through the *presence awareness* features in some
    instant messaging applications. Also known as *buddy lists*, these
    features can be used by employees to quickly discover the
    availability of supervisors or coworkers for advice or problem
    solving.  
        
     This reading also covers what you need to know for subunit
    4.3.1.1.  
        
     Reading this section and taking notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.

**4.3.1.2 E-mail** <span id="4.3.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading in subunit 4.3.1 and by the
video below. Many businesses use e-mail to respond to product inquiries
and to handle customer concerns or complaints. Some businesses provide
an e-mail address on the* Contact Us*page of their websites, but others
choose to use contact forms which customers must fill out to send a
message. These forms can be set up with autoresponders that
automatically send an e-mail back to the customer, acknowledging receipt
of their message. These autoresponders also pass the message along to a
customer service agent via e-mail, or sometimes IM. This agent can then
either call or e-mail the customer with a response. As with instant
messaging, it is important that you become aware of these newer trends
in business communication so you are prepared to use them if asked.*

**4.3.1.3 Memo** <span id="4.3.1.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: The Saylor Foundation’s *Business Communication for
    Success*: “Chapter 9: Section 9.2”**
    Link: The Saylor Foundation’s *Business Communication for Success*:
    [“Chapter 9: Section
    9.2”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Business%20Communication%20for%20Success.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: If you have already downloaded *Business
    Communication for Success*, read section 9.2: “Memorandums and
    Letters” on pages 332–340.  
        
     Notice that memos are not used in direct customer service
    exchanges; however, depending on the business you work for, you may
    encounter them as a form of communication between management and
    workers.  
        
     Although uncommon, customers may occasionally choose this method to
    communicate with a department. In such cases, your own use of this
    method will usually involve using a template – a preset format –
    which you would follow to present your message.  
        
     This reading material also covers what you need to know for subunit
    4.3.1.4.  
        
     Reading this section and taking notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.

     Instructions: Watch this video, which provides additional
    information about these two forms of written business communication.
    This video also covers what you need to know in subunit 4.3.1.4.  
        
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 15 minutes.

**4.3.1.4 Letter** <span id="4.3.1.4"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading and video in subunit
4.3.1.3. Recognize that there are still many customers who do not use
electronic communication, which means that letter writing remains a
necessary part of customer service. Keep in mind, however, that while
there are many issues you may need to resolve by writing a letter, the
Internet still provides you with shortcuts that can make your job
simpler. For example,*
*[OfficeWriting.com](http://officewriting.com/category/sample-letters/customer-service-letter/) is
just one of many websites that provide sample content for an assortment
of letter-writing needs, such as payment-not-in-envelope letters,
billing error apology letters, out-of-stock letters, or check-not-signed
letters.*

    an important step in ensuring that your own résumé is as relevant
    and functional as possible.

    subsection.  
        
     This reading is comprised entirely of a table which provides the
    name, definition, and an example of 17 organizing principles. All of
    these principles are necessary for you to understand and use as an
    effective communicator. They are practical, everyday ways to arrange
    information in letters, reports, e-mails, or even your résumé. As a
    result, memorizing as many of these principles as possible is a good
    way to expand your versatility as a communicator.  
        
     To help you make distinctions between the principles, this subunit
    has divided them into two groups: “strategic principles” and “other
    principles.”  
        
     The strategic principles are particularly useful in planning the
    details a customer service agent may need to communicate. For this
    reason, this subunit – and questions on the final exam – will focus
    on the strategic principles in the table.  
        
     This reading covers the material you need to know for subunits
    4.4.1 through 4.4.3.  
        
     Reading this selection and memorizing as many of the organizing
    principles as possible should take approximately 1 hour.

**4.4.1 Strategic Principles** <span id="4.4.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned in subunit 4.4. A
strategy is simply a plan: a way to achieve a specific goal. Each of the
topics included in this subunit are the options you have for reaching
that goal using verbal communication.*

**4.4.1.1 Comparison and Contrast** <span id="4.4.1.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned in subunit 4.4.
The first important thing to notice is that every topic you can imagine
can be discussed using any one, or a combination, of these organizing
principles. In order to help you understand how useful these strategies
are, as you study the principles try to apply each one to the topic of
doorknobs in a logical way. For example, in a customer service exchange,
you might find yourself needing to compare and contrast different types
of doorknobs.  *

**4.4.1.2 Cause and Effect** <span id="4.4.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 4.4. How can
the strategy of cause or effect be used with doorknobs? You might have
to describe what caused one doorknob manufacturer to include a
particular feature and what the effect of that feature is on how
customers might use it or on the price of the doorknob.*

**4.4.1.3 Problem and Solution** <span id="4.4.1.3"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 4.4. When might
you have to describe the solution to a problem involving doorknobs?
Perhaps the customer has an older door with a larger hole for the base
of the doorknob, something which the customer discovered after buying a
knob that did not fit. You may have to describe to the customer how he
or she can solve the problem by purchasing a different doorknob design
that you are aware of or by using a specially designed flange beneath
the base of the doorknob.*

**4.4.1.4 Advantages and Disadvantages** <span id="4.4.1.4"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 4.4. When a
customer is trying to decide which type of doorknob locking mechanism he
or she should choose, you may want to list the advantages and
disadvantages of each type so that the customer is better informed.*

**4.4.1.5 Process and Procedure** <span id="4.4.1.5"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 4.4. Many of
your customers may want to save money by self-installing the doorknobs
they purchase from your department. You might choose to familiarize
yourself with the typical ways doorknobs are installed so that you can
describe that process to customers and help them decide if they are
capable of completing it or should seek more experienced help.*

**4.4.1.6 Classification (Categorical)** <span id="4.4.1.6"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 4.4. There are
many different types, designs, and brands of doorknobs. If you sell a
lot of them, you probably should be prepared to describe the categories
of doorknobs that customers can choose from.*

**4.4.1.7 Elimination** <span id="4.4.1.7"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 4.4. If a
customer is unsure about the type of doorknob he or she requires, you
might help the person decide by going through a list of traits and
eliminating the ones that the customer identifies as unsuitable.*

**4.4.1.8 Example** <span id="4.4.1.8"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 4.4. Sometimes,
you may have to educate a customer on how a doorknob works, but the
customer may be unable to visualize how its mechanisms interact. To help
the customer understand, you might use an example of a similar mechanism
– one that the customer probably is already familiar with. For example,
the way in which one gear can be used to turn another is an example of
the same mechanism the spindle in a doorknob uses to turn the latch.*

**4.4.1.9 Point Pattern** <span id="4.4.1.9"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 4.4. This
strategy is most often used to persuade. To recommend one type of
doorknob over another, you might lay out, point-by-point, the reasons
why the customer’s needs are better met by a particular design.*

**4.4.1.10 Definition** <span id="4.4.1.10"></span> 
 *Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 4.4.
Definition is a strategy that is used to describe unfamiliar terms or
concepts. When choosing a doorknob, it may be important for the customer
to understand certain terms that reflect how the doorknob must be
installed, such as* door swing*, which indicates in which direction a
door opens and thus on which side of the door the doorknob is placed.*

**4.4.2 Other Principles** <span id="4.4.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned in subunit 4.4.
The principles in this subunit – chronological, biographical,
psychological, spatial, ascending/descending, testimonial, and
ceremonial – are not as versatile in their applications as the strategic
principles discussed in the doorknob example in subunits 4.4.1.1 through
4.4.1.10.*  
    
 *Specifically, the chronological, biographical, spatial, and
ascending/descending strategies are used almost exclusively to organize
content rather than as a strategic way to provide information.
Meanwhile, the psychological, testimonial, and ceremonial strategies are
used for special occasions or under special conditions, both of which
limit their strategic usefulness.*  
    
 *Nevertheless, as with all of the principles, memorizing this group in
addition to the others in the table will enable you to organize
information more quickly and be more versatile in how you communicate
information.*
