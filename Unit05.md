**Unit 5: Speaking to Customers** <span id="5"></span> 
*What percentage of an actor’s or actress’s performance on the stage
succeeds because of what he or she does versus what he or she says? The
best thespians know more than their lines; they also know their craft. A
good customer service representative needs to be well versed in the
craft of public speaking. To present information, respond to requests,
influence buying decisions, and in other ways satisfy your customers’
needs, it is essential that you speak clearly and persuasively.
Unfortunately, one issue that causes many speakers to become tongue tied
is when they have to present important details from memory. This unit
concludes with a section on memory aids to encourage you to use
techniques that will not only help you remember but also, hopefully,
ease your anxiety about having to remember and speak at the same
time.*  
    
 *Sir Winston Churchill, statesman, orator, and former British prime
minister, said: “A good speech should be like a woman's skirt: long
enough to cover the subject and short enough to create
interest.”[[1]](#_ftn1)*

    Instructions: Watch this series of four videos, which describe,
    often humorously, several critical conversation *talking points*
    that many customer service agents deal with frequently. Although the

    relates to face-to-face customer service settings as well. You will
    also notice some overlap between the videos; however, do not assume
    that they are redundant. Each video provides an additional
    perspective on the topics, and all are framed to offer realistic
    advice for any face-to-face customer service encounter.

    Link: Ludism.org’s [“What Must We
    Remember”](http://www.ludism.org/mentat/WhatMustWeRemember) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this article; however, when you encounter the
    last two paragraphs, recognize that they contain ill-advised
    information that is based on two assumptions: that most people (1)
    have all of their important phone numbers programmed into their cell
    phones, and (2) can access their cell phones while on the job.
    Hence, unlike the advice given in the article, phone numbers remain
    yet another kind of information that it is wise to work on
    remembering.  
        
     This reading provides an introduction to why you need memory aids
    and how to use them to improve your ability to communicate
    accurately. The subunits that follow cover in greater depth some of
    the techniques you can use.  
        
     Reading this article and taking notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.

    Link: Ludism.org’s [“Mnemonic
    Cues”](http://www.ludism.org/mentat/MnemonicCues) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this webpage, which provides an overview of the
    techniques you can use to remember things like names, dates,
    numbers, locations, and more. You will discover several links in
    these readings which lead to other topics. While you can click on
    those links at any time, recognize that those topics will be covered
    in upcoming subunits.  
        
     Reading this webpage and taking notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.

**5.2.2 Memory Systems** <span id="5.2.2"></span> 
**5.2.2.1 The Link System** <span id="5.2.2.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Ludism.org’s “Link System”**
    Link: Ludism.org’s [“Link
    System”](http://www.ludism.org/mentat/LinkSystem) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this webpage, which describes one of the
    simplest mnemonics. It is based on a general approach referred to as
    *pegging*, wherein you treat what you need to remember like a coat
    that you hang on a peg. Remembering where or what the *peg* is
    enables you to remember the coat itself.  
        
     Because mnemonics can seem a bit intimidating at first, the link
    system is being introduced first because of its relative simplicity
    even though, technically, it is a subcategory of the peg system,
    which is discussed next.  
        
     Reading this webpage and taking notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.

**5.2.2.2 The Peg System** <span id="5.2.2.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: Ludism.org’s “Peg System”**
    Link: Ludism.org’s [“Peg
    System”](http://www.ludism.org/mentat/PegSystem) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this webpage, which describes the basis of a
    number of mnemonic cues called *pegging*. Keep in mind that not all
    mnemonics suit every person. Consider this as you review not only
    this reading but also other mnemonic systems that are closely
    related to the peg system, such as the link system discussed in
    subunit 5.2.2.1 and the memory palace covered in subunit 5.2.2.3.  
        
     To find the techniques that suit you, take the time to click on the
    links to other systems as well. Take a moment to skim the concepts
    to decide whether you can quickly grasp the instructions. If you
    cannot, return to the readings that have been specifically assigned
    for this subunit.  
        
     The techniques covered here have been chosen primarily because they
    use easy-to-understand language and are relatively simple to
    apply.  
        
     Reading this webpage and taking notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.

    evaluate how well these other systems might work for you.  
        
     Reading this webpage, exploring some of the links it contains, and

     Instructions: This simple test will enable you to discover the
    limits of your ability to remember words. This website is designed
    to help you expand your abilities by testing you and then linking
    you to resources which can help you improve in specific ways.  
        
     While many of the resources cover the same information provided in
    this subunit, you may also find additional information that will
    help you expand your memory. To discover whether or not the
    resources are helpful, test yourself again using this activity while
    applying the techniques you’ve learned.  
        
     Completing one test, reviewing the linked resources to help you
    improve, and then testing yourself again should take approximately
    30 minutes; although, your time will vary depending on the number of
    tests you choose to take.
