**Unit 3: Listening to Your Customers** <span id="3"></span> 
*In contrast to actors who perform on television or in film, the stage
actor performs in front of a live audience. Because there are no cameras
to stop and restart in order to record a better version, the stage actor
has to get it right the first time. Luckily, live audiences can
communicate to the actors on the stage. They can shout, laugh, nod,
scream, squirm, yawn, or even fall asleep. Actors can use audience
reactions to make subtle changes in their live performance and also to
make changes in between performances. Their use of audience feedback is
similar to how customer service experts must gather feedback from
customers by using effective listening skills. Also like actors,
customer service experts should respond to both verbal and nonverbal
indications of what their customers are feeling and thinking. This unit
focuses on how you can use active listening to understand the messages
your customers are sending, both verbally and nonverbally.*  
    
 *Robert Baden-Powell, founder of The Boy Scouts, said, “If you make
listening and observation your occupation, you will gain much more than
you can by talk.”[[1]](#_ftn1)*

    Link: SkillsYouNeed.com’s [“Listening
    Skills”](http://www.skillsyouneed.com/ips/listening-skills.html) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this article, paying particular attention to the
    differences between hearing and listening as well as to the list of
    10 behaviors you should adopt to make your listening skills more
    effective. Since this reading is quite brief, yet packed with
    advice, a scenario has been integrated into the subunits below to
    enable you to consider each suggestion in a realistic context.  
        
     This reading covers the material you need to know for subunits
    3.2.1 through 3.2.10.  
        
     Reading this article and taking notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.  
        
     Terms of Use: Please respect the copyright and terms of use
    displayed on the webpage above.

**3.2.1 Resist the Urge to Just Talk** <span id="3.2.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 3.2.*  
  
 *Scenario: You are tidying up the shelves in the children’s section of
the bookstore when a customer approaches you. She mentions how much she
liked the book you just put back on the shelf and starts describing her
favorite parts. How should you respond? *

**3.2.2 Get Yourself Ready to Listen** <span id="3.2.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 3.2.*  
    
 *Scenario: You’ve responded to the woman who approached you in the
children’s section by setting down the books you were handling, turning
to face her to give her your full attention, and establishing eye
contact. What should you plan to do next? *

**3.2.3 Get the Speaker to Feel Comfortable** <span id="3.2.3"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 3.2.*  
    
 *Scenario: You are focused on the woman and waiting for her to finish
describing the book she enjoyed. She notices this and hesitates, growing
somewhat embarrassed by enthusiasm. What should you do? *

**3.2.4 Get Rid of Distractions** <span id="3.2.4"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 3.2.*  
    
 *Scenario: To make the woman feel comfortable, you smile at her and nod
to signal your appreciation for her ideas. This makes her relax and
gives you the opportunity to ask her if she is looking for a similar
book. She says that she was actually just looking for someone to help
her find an adult book. However, before she can continue, another woman
with two toddlers and a child in a baby carriage turn down the aisle.
The toddlers run ahead to the play station nearby and start noisily
rearranging the toys. What should you do? *

**3.2.5 Demonstrate Empathy** <span id="3.2.5"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 3.2.*  
    
 *Scenario: By pointing toward the adult section, you’ve encouraged the
woman to walk with you away from the distracting toddlers. As you enter
the first of many aisles of adult books, the woman expresses how lost
she feels because there are so many books to choose from. How should you
respond? *

**3.2.6 Demonstrate Patience** <span id="3.2.6"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 3.2.*  
    
 *Scenario: You’ve responded to the woman’s admission that she feels
lost by indicating that you, too, are sometimes overwhelmed by the
choices that are available, but you have a technique that helps you make
decisions. You tell her how you start by asking yourself what type of
book you want: something educational or something entertaining? You
proceed by dividing the adult books into various categories, but the
woman rejects each one. How should you proceed? *

**3.2.7 Demonstrate Neutrality** <span id="3.2.7"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 3.2.*  
    
 *Scenario: You’ve completed your list of book categories, but the woman
still has not chosen anything. You give her some time to think and wait
for her to reinitiate the conversation. When she asks for more ideas,
you start going back through the list again, this time mentioning some
popular authors and titles in each category. Now the woman becomes more
animated, interrupting you or talking over your words to express sharp
criticism about several of the authors you bring up. What should you do
next? *

**3.2.8 Pay Attention to the Speaker’s Tone** <span id="3.2.8"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 3.2.*  
    
 *Scenario: Each time the woman negatively reacts to your author
suggestions, you nod and smile at her to communicate to her that you are
not judging her by her opinions. Finally, you mention an author she
likes and lead her over to the section where that author’s hardcover
books are shelved. The woman takes a few out and ruffles through the
pages, stopping to read neither the printed preview on the inside jacket
cover nor any of the pages she flips through. Instead, she talks
wistfully about how thick the books are and how attractive each book
jacket is. How should you react?*

**3.2.9 Pay Attention to the Speaker’s Ideas** <span id="3.2.9"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 3.2.*  
    
 *Scenario: Recognizing from the woman’s tone that she has become less
enthusiastic, you suspect she may not be able to afford hardcover books,
so you mention that the author also has several books that have been
published in paperback as well as hardcover. The woman thanks you for
the suggestion and then compliments you on how knowledgeable you are
about books and authors. She asks you whether you know of any new
authors who have written novels similar to the popular author she was
interested in – promising writers whose books may be worth purchasing in
hardcover. What should you do next?*

**3.2.10 Pay Attention to Nonverbal Communication** <span
id="3.2.10"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 3.2.*  
    
 *Scenario: You realize that the ideas the speaker has expressed – her
appreciation for your knowledge, her curiosity about new authors, and
her desire to still buy a hardcover – may indicate that she would be
interested in the store’s bargain book bin. You mention that she may
find what she is looking for there. In response, the woman frowns, her
face reddening as she mumbles her thanks for your help and then walks
away.*  
    
 *You did everything right up to this point, so why did you lose this
customer? When the woman first approached you, you were handling a
classic, in hardcover. When the two of you moved to the adult section,
the woman became very animated when discussing authors. Then she handled
and discussed the hardcovers themselves with great appreciation for how
each book looked.*  
    
 *Throughout these parts of your exchange with the woman, you failed to
notice what she didn’t say verbally but did say nonverbally: quality
counts. The childhood classic, the unworthy authors, the nicely bound
and jacketed hardcovers, her willingness to consider a promising new
author – these observations demonstrated that the woman was most engaged
when she was considering the quality of the book or its author. Thus,
suggesting the bargain book bin both insulted and embarrassed her since
the offer showed you had misinterpreted her responses and perhaps
exposed her to your pity.*  
    
 *Had you listened more carefully to the woman’s ideas and not jumped to
the conclusion that her indecision was about money, not quality, you may
have been able to use your knowledge about the books to recommend to her
a young author gaining an unusual amount of recognition – also published
in hardcover, but possibly less expensive due to the author’s lack of
exposure. *

**3.5.1.1 Smiling** <span id="3.5.1.1"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 3.5 and the
video in subunit 3.5.1.* *Smiles are signs of not only affirmation but
also acceptance, encouragement, appreciation, and interest. That’s a lot
for one gesture, but that list shows just how powerful smiling can be in
enabling a productive conversation. Indeed, a popular Chinese proverb
states:* “A man without a smiling face must not open a shop*.*”*Clearly,
smiling is a technique that has been used for ages to make customers
feel comfortable.*  
  

**3.5.1.2 Direct Eye Contact** <span id="3.5.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 3.5 and the
video in subunit 3.5.1.* *An important take-away about this topic is
that you should assess how much eye contact the customer is comfortable
with. Too much can make a person uncomfortable. Too little can make it
seem like you are not interested. Moreover, cultural norms can determine
how to use eye contact. What is important is that you keep thinking
about the customer’s nonverbal feedback so you can change the directness
of your eye contact if necessary. *

**3.5.1.3 Attentive Posture** <span id="3.5.1.3"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 3.5 and the
video in subunit 3.5.1.* *These resources briefly cover how leaning in
or away as well as tilting your head and other body positions can signal
to a customer that you are interested in their needs. However, realize
too that your posture – specifically, how you stand or sit – can also
signal how you feel about yourself and your environment. Being still,
but not stiff; square shoulders instead of drooping ones; having your
hands in your pockets instead of out where they can be seen and used for
gesturing; facing your customer directly instead of being slightly
turned away – all of these postures can signal a positive or negative
attitude and whether you are confident or unsure.*

**3.5.1.4 Mirroring the Speaker’s Expressions** <span
id="3.5.1.4"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 3.5 and the
video in subunit 3.5.1.* *Mirroring can be an easy subject to recognize
but a difficult one to visualize. If you aren’t sure how you can do this
yourself, consider watching the excellent how-to video in the following
resource box, which breaks down the steps for a consciously applied
process of mirroring. *

**3.5.2.2 Remembering** <span id="3.5.2.2"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 3.5.* *Having a
good memory is always an asset when it comes to selling products or
serving customers. Throughout this course, we have emphasized how
important it is to recognize and accommodate customers’ needs, wants,
and expectations. However, individual customers differ widely – and
loyal ones come back.*

**3.5.2.6 Summarizing** <span id="3.5.2.6"></span> 
*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading in subunit 3.5.* *Many
people are not really aware of what a summary is. One way to understand
it better is to first recognize what it is not. Summarizing is not
presenting what a person said or wrote word for word – that is called a
quotation.*  
    
 *Summarizing is also not presenting what a person said in the same way
and depth as the person put it originally but in your own language –
that is called a paraphrase.*  
    
 *A summary is a shortened, more concise, yet accurate version of the
original statement. It uses fewer words, most of which you come up with
on your own as opposed to quoting from the source. Summaries are used as
a more efficient way to report what was said. Because neither a
quotation nor a paraphrase is efficient, a summary is a very important
technique to use when listening and responding to customers. It is often
used to confirm that you heard the customer accurately.*  
    
 *If you are unfamiliar with this technique, consider reading the
supplemental material provided in the resource box below.*
